# Quick start

## Introduction to sqlfluff

With multiple contributors to a project and varying technical backgrounds, it's really difficult to maintain consistent readability and comprehension across a codebase.
sqlfluff is a tool that can easily checkout sql code quality with varying SQL backgrounds and dialects.

## Python Requirement

Sqlfluff not support for python 2, it need python 3+. Check your python version with the following:

```bash
$ python --version
```

## Quick install 

Install sqlfluff with pip: `pip install sqlfluff`

Check if installation succeeds: `pip install sqlfluff`


## Hands on demo
We can use command line to quick check the sql code quality. Here we use an example, save the example to a sql file.
```sql
SELECT a+b  AS foo,
c AS bar from my_table
```
cd to the folder and run the test
```bash
$ cd /test/doc
$ sqlfluff lint test_sqlfulff.sql --dialect ansi
```
output:
```
== [test_sqlfulff.sql] FAIL

```
The sqlfluff checker will tell what is needed to take care.
To further understand the rule, check https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/rules.html#ruleref

Automatically fix the issue with specify rule:

```bash
$ sqlfluff fix test_sqlfulff.sql --rules L003,L009,L010 --dialect ansi
```

## Customer style
In lint command can specify to use different kind of dialect for varying SQL backend.
Check the currently support backend:

```bash
$ sqlfluff dialects
```
```output
==== sqlfluff - dialects ====
ansi:                 ansi dialect [inherits from 'nothing']
bigquery:            bigquery dialect [inherits from 'ansi']
db2:                      db2 dialect [inherits from 'ansi']
exasol:                exasol dialect [inherits from 'ansi']
```
All dialects are inherited from basic ansi dialects. If we want to customize dialects, we need to fork the git repo and create new class.

Lint command also can specify which rules to use to check. To list the currently support rules:

```bash
$ sqlfluff rules
```

```output
==== sqlfluff - rules ====
L001: Unnecessary trailing whitespace.                                          
L002: Mixed Tabs and Spaces in single whitespace.                               
L003: Indentation not consistent with previous lines.   
```

Rules are predefined, but it is flexible at parameter and usage.
All the settings can be specified in a `.sqlfluff` file.
Change the config file, the customer style will be applied immediately.

Only enable few rule:

```config
rules = L001,L002 (default :all)
```

Ignore specify rule: 

```config
exclude_rules = L001,L002
```

To customize a specific rule, parameters are predefined:

```config
[sqlfluff:rules:L010]
capitalisation_policy = consistent
ignore_words = from
ignore_words_regex = None
```

## Jinjia Template

SQL fluff also support template replacement by variables for flexibility.
By default, it is Jinja template, and we also use Jinja as example here.

```sql
SELECT a+b  AS foo,
c AS bar from my_table where name = {{ test_name }}; 
```

Set the value of the parameter in the config file `.sqlfluff`:

```config
[sqlfluff:templater:jinja:context]
test_name=456
```

After this, you can get the parsed result by run the following command:

```bash
$ sqlfluff parse test_sqlfulff.sql --rules L003,L009,L010 --dialect ansi
```

# Easy sql integration Plan

1. Parse the backend config in easy sql to define the dialect
2. Our easy sql have multiple sql with comment as seperator. Add for-loop to loop through all different sql file
3. Make rules enable /disable for different sql backend. For example, bigquery specific need schema.
4. Add rules to check, including input/output check, partition check
5. Allow for easy_sql function  and variable like ${temp_db} to be checked.


refer dbt tool but it is static
