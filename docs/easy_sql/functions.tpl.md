# Functions

While most of the ETL code is SQL, sometimes we would like to do things that are difficult to implement in SQL.

For example:

- Send out a http request to report status when some step of the ETL fails for some reasons.
- Check if a partition exists.
- Get the first partition value.

These tasks could be easily implemented in python functions.

Easy SQL provides a way to call functions in ETL code. And there are a bunch of useful python functions provided by Easy SQL.
These functions are widely used in ETL development.

## Use functions in ETL

To use the functions provided by Easy SQL, nothing need to be done. Just call it in a `func` `check` or `variables` step.

If you would like to implement a new function and use it in ETL, you need to register it before the execution of the ETL.

Let's have a look at a simple example of how to create and register a new function and use it in ETL.

### Implement your customized function

First of all, you need to implement your function in a python file.
Let's assume we're using spark backend, and the function we'd like to implement is a function to count the partitions of some table.

We could create a file named `customized_func.py`, with content:

```python
def count_partitions(table_name: str) -> int:
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    spark: SparkSession = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
    partitions = spark.sql(f'show partitions {table_name}').collect()
    return len(partitions)
```

### Use function in ETL

If we use the command line interface to run the ETL, we need to configure it with a property named `easy_sql.func_file_path` in your ETL file.
An example is as below:

```sql
-- backend: spark
-- config: easy_sql.func_file_path=customized_func.py

-- target=action.define_table
create table some_table partitioned by (pt) as
select * from (
    select 1 as a, 2 as b, 1 as pt
    union
    select 1 as a, 2 as b, 2 as pt
) t

-- target=log.partition_count
select ${count_partitions(some_table)} as partition_count
```

If we save the above content to a file named `etl_with_customized_func.sql`, and run it with command:

```bash
bash -c "$(python3 -m easy_sql.data_process -f etl_with_customized_func.sql -p)"
```

We'll see the output like below:

```
===================== REPORT FOR step-1 ==================
config: StepConfig(target=action.define_table, condition=None, line_no=4)
sql: create table some_table partitioned by (pt) as
select * from (
    select 1 as a, 2 as b, 1 as pt
    union
    select 1 as a, 2 as b, 2 as pt
) t
status: SUCCEEDED
start time: 2022-08-03 10:33:33, end time: 2022-08-03 10:33:43, execution time: 9.839801s - 96.62%
messages:


===================== REPORT FOR step-2 ==================
config: StepConfig(target=log.partition_count, condition=None, line_no=12)
sql: select 2 as partition_count
status: SUCCEEDED
start time: 2022-08-03 10:33:43, end time: 2022-08-03 10:33:43, execution time: 0.254982s - 2.50%
messages:
partition_count=2
```

**Notes:**

- The command line interface will import and register all the functions in the python file. So we suggest defining all of your functions in a `__all__` variable.
- The function file path in configuration `-- config: easy_sql.func_file_path=some_function.py` is either an absolute path or a path relative to current working directory.

### Register functions programmatically

Easy SQL also provides a way to register functions programmatically.
The api to register functions is [`register_funcs_from_pyfile`](https://easy-sql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/easy_sql/sql_processor/sql_processor/index.html#easy_sql.sql_processor.sql_processor.SqlProcessor.register_funcs_from_pyfile).

The example code to register functions is:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

from easy_sql.sql_processor import SqlProcessor
from easy_sql.sql_processor.backend import SparkBackend

if __name__ == '__main__':
    spark = SparkSession.builder.enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()
    backend = SparkBackend(spark)
    sql = '''
-- target=log.some_log
select 1 as a
    '''
    sql_processor = SqlProcessor(backend, sql)
    sql_processor.register_funcs_from_pyfile('some_function.py')
    sql_processor.run()
```

**Note:**

- The python file `some_function.py` must be able to be found in module search path (Add the directory path of the file to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable).

## Builtin and operator functions

By default, Easy SQL imported all the functions in python `builtin` module and `operator` module.

So we can use any functions listed here:

- [`builtin` functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-funcs)
- [`operator` functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#module-operator)

For convenience, there are several utility functions implemented as well:

- `equal(a: any, b: any)`
- `is_greater_or_equal(a: str|int|float, b: str|int|float)`
- `equal_ignore_case(a: str, b: str)`
